## Quick Render Buttons

The [_Quick Render Buttons_](https://github.com/Thane5/quickrenderbuttons) add-on [here](https://github.com/Thane5/quickrenderbuttons) is a simple but handy add-on which includes a button for Playblasts by _DuBlast_ (you'll need to install both addons).

## Difference between *DuBlast* and the native *Viewport Render Animation* command

|DuBlast|Viewport Render Animation|
|---------|---------------------------|
|**Automatically plays** the rendered animation|Needs the user to **manually play** the animation [Ctrl] + [F11]|
|**Has its own output settings**, so the user can create playblasts without altering the output settings of the scene|**Shares the output settings** with the scene/render settings, which means the user has to alter the output settings even if they're already set for rendering the scene|
|Has **custom output format presets** for better animation playback and seek|Needs the user to **manually set the output** to an animator friendly format|
|**Scales down the size of the text for the metadata** according to the resolution %|**Keeps the same size for the text of the metadata**, no matter the output resolution, which results in huge texts at lower resolution|
|Atomatically adjusts the rendered animation dimension to **fit the *MP4* requirements** when set to use *MP4*|The user has to **find a fitting resolution %** for the dimensions to have an even number of lines and columns|
